# Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing

This repo is dedicated to my notes and work on exercises while reading through the book "Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing" by Thomas G. Wong. The ISBN is `979-8-98559831-0-5` if anybody would like to read along. If you have any questions/comments/concerns with any of my notes or work, please feel free to submit a PR as I am certainly new to the topic of Quantum Computing, and would love to interact with others alongside the learning process!
