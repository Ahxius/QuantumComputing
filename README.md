# Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing

This repo is dedicated to my notes and work on exercises while reading through the book "Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing" by Thomas G. Wong. The ISBN is `979-8-98559831-0-5` if anybody would like to read along. If you have any questions/comments/concerns with any of my notes or work, please feel free to submit a PR as I am certainly new to the topic of Quantum Computing, and would love to interact with others alongside the learning process!

The answers to the exercises is provided at the end of the book. I will be referring to these at the end of every section, and including my work, as well as the work that fits the answer - as well is if they contrast.

## Contents
In order to simplify the structure of the repo, there will be directories for each section and subdirectories for each section. To reference, I'll include hyperlinks to each chapter below, as well as their title.

1. Classical Information and Computation
2. One Quantum Bit
3. Linear Algebra
4. Multiple Quantum Bits
5. Quantum Programming
6. Entanglement and Quantum Protocols
7. Quantum Algorithms
8. Next Steps
